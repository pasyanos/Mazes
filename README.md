### This repository is a Python implementation of exercises and algorithms from the book *Mazes for Programmers* by Jamis Buck.
It may not be a replica of the book, as I have made changes to convert the code to Python and for my own coding preferences.

Note: I used GitHub Copilot as an aid in writing portions of this code, however, I have tested all code and I take responsibility for its functionality and maintenance.
